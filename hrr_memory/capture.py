"""Auto-capture engine for holographic memory.

Buffers conversation turns from sync_turn() and periodically compresses
them into structured facts via the host-owned LLM (ctx.llm).

Architecture
------------
CaptureEngine.observe_turn(messages) is called from sync_turn() after
each turn. It appends the turn's messages to an internal ring buffer.
Every ``interval`` turns (or on explicit compress_and_store()), it:

1. Builds a compression prompt from the buffered messages
2. Calls ctx.llm.complete() to extract structured observations
3. Parses the LLM response (one observation per line)
4. Stores each via store.add_fact() with category="auto_capture"

The buffer is then cleared so the next interval starts fresh.

_COMPRESSION_PROMPT = """You are observing a conversation between a user and an AI agent.
Extract compact, durable facts from the conversation below.

Rules:
- One fact per line, each starting with "- "
- Keep facts short (under 200 chars each)
- Only extract facts the user would want the agent to remember long-term
- Skip: greetings, pleasantries, trivial chat
- Skip: instructions the agent just followed (those are ephemeral)
- Skip: task progress and session state — PR/issue numbers, commit SHAs, branch names, file counts, test counts, "fixed X", "submitted Y", prices/values observed this session, "stored fact id N", "created skill X"
- Include: user preferences and corrections, decisions made, durable environment facts (paths, credentials locations, tool quirks), project conventions, stable workflows
- Durability test: would this fact still be true and worth knowing in 30 days? If not, skip it.

Tagging (append one tag in parentheses at line end, no spaces inside):
- If the fact is borderline session state that must still be captured (e.g. a paused job, a pending decision), append "(entity:cron)"
- Otherwise no tag

Examples:
[Conversation]
User: I just opened PR #42 for the new authentication flow.
Agent: Great! I also fixed the failing unit tests.
User: Good. Remember that staging database credentials are in ~/.config/app/secrets.json.
Agent: Noted. I'll remember that.
User: Oh, and pause the 'weekly report' cron job until I review the metrics.
[Facts]
- Environment: Staging database credentials are stored in ~/.config/app/secrets.json.
- Cron 'weekly report' is paused awaiting user review of metrics. (entity:cron)

Conversation:
{conversation}
